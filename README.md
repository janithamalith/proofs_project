# proofs_project

Welcome to **proofs_project**! 

This repository contains a collection of formalizations of various small theorems and mathematical facts that Iâ€™ve encountered and found interesting during my math journey. These are mostly exploratory and aim to deepen my understanding of formal reasoning using Lean 4.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!
